        <p>I am studying Computer Science as part of a Masters Conversion program
            in University College Dublin, due to graduate in December 2023. I am an active
            member in the UCD Mountaineering Club having been the Health and Safety Officer in 21/22.
            This means I spend 2-3 evenings a week climbing at the UCD Wall. Whilst on the weekends I can be found hiking in 
            Wicklow or on a club trip to other mountain regions in Ireland.
        </p>
        <p>In the mornings I usually do yoga with the <a href="https://www.downdogapp.com/">Down Dog</a> app.
            It is free for students to use. Afterwards I use Sam Harris' meditation app <a href="https://www.wakingup.com/">Waking Up</a>. 
            I have found Waking Up to be a very valuable resource and have written more about it <a href="wup.html">here</a>.
