            My name is Cian Belton. I was born and raised in the midlands of Ireland. I was born in 2001. My mother and father are both Irish.
            I have one brother who is 3 years younger than me. I enjoyed both primary and seconadary school and had a good balance of academics and 
            sports throughout. 
            I played <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEAbWrdB9XU">Gaelic Football</a> competitively until I was 19. The main reason 
            I stopped was that I lost interest in the sport once I came to college. I now find sports like rock climbing and hiking
            much more enjoyable.

        <p>Below you will find a local video of me in Colorado.</p>

        <p>As you can see it is sometimes hard to remain in control of things
            once they have been set in motion.
