Responsive Elements:
-the div class=wrap applied to all elements on every page
of my website keeps the width of content at 90% regardless of
window size. Padding and margin are also set to be responsive.
-Padding for paragaphs as a percentage of window size
-Any auto feature used. For example in section table on home page I set the 
left margin to auto.
-overflow-x:auto for the table on cian.html used as a div element. This meant
the table would be accessible to smaller window sizes by creating a bottom scroll bar
-Video on about.html has width and height set to percentages to adapt responsively to the window size.
